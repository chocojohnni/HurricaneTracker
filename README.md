This project consists of methods that'll track a hurricane using turtle, a canvas, and algortihms. We create a definition called irma to signify the hurricane name.
We take in a file name of the hurricane's statistics and tell the turtle to do different algorithms. Depending on the different speeds and winds of the hurricane, the turtle
will draw an illustration of the hurricane across the world map.
